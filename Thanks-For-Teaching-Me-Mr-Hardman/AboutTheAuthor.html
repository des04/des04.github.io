                Suzanne Collins is an American television writer and author.
                She is known as the author of The New York Times best-selling
                series The Underland Chronicles and The Hunger Games trilogy.
                Collins began her career in 1991 as a writer for children's
                television shows. She worked on several shows for Nickelodeon,
                including Clarissa Explains It All, The Mystery Files of Shelby
                Woo, Little Bear, and Oswald. She did not write the children's
                book Little Bear, which is sometimes mistaken as her own book.
                She was also the head writer for Scholastic Entertainment's
                Clifford's Puppy Days. She received a Writers Guild of
                America nomination in animation for co-writing the critically
                acclaimed Christmas special, Santa, Baby!
                After meeting children's author James Proimos while working on
                the Kids' WB show Generation O!, Collins felt inspired to write
                children's books herself. Her inspiration for Gregor the
                Overlander, the first book of The New York Times best-selling
                series The Underland Chronicles, came from Alice in Wonderland,
                when she was thinking about how one was more likely to fall down
                a manhole than a rabbit hole, and would find something other than
                a tea party. Between 2003 and 2007 she wrote the five books of
                the Underland Chronicles: Gregor the Overlander, Gregor and the
                Prophecy of Bane, Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, Gregor
                and the Marks of Secret, and Gregor and the Code of Claw. During
                that time, Collins also wrote a rhyming picture book, When Charlie
                McButton Lost Power (2005), illustrated by Mike Lester.
                In September 2008, Scholastic Press released The Hunger Games, the
                first book of a trilogy by Collins. The Hunger Games was partly
                inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. Another
                inspiration was her father's career in the Air Force, which gave her
                insight to poverty, starvation, and the effects of war. The trilogy's
                second book, Catching Fire, was released in September 2009, and its
                third book, Mockingjay, was released on August 24, 2010. Within 14
                months, 1.5 million copies of the first two Hunger Games books were
                printed in North America alone. The Hunger Games was on The New
                York Times Best Seller list for more than 60 weeks in a row. Lions
                Gate Entertainment acquired worldwide distribution rights to a film
                adaptation of The Hunger Games, produced by Nina Jacobson's Color
                Force production company. Collins adapted the novel for film herself.
                Directed by Gary Ross, filming began in late spring 2011, with Jennifer
                Lawrence portraying main character Katniss Everdeen. Josh Hutcherson
                played Peeta Mellark and Liam Hemsworth played Gale Hawthorne. The
                subsequent two novels were adapted into films as well, with the latter
                book split into two cinematic installments, for a total of four films
                representing the three books.
