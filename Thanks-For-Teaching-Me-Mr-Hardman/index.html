                    Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The

                    12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place.

                    on the Victor's Tour, but before leaving, Katniss is visited by President Snow who fears
                    that Katniss defied him a year ago during the games when she chose to die with Peeta. With both Katniss

                    the flames or else everyone she cares about will be in danger.
