                “There have been a number of outstanding dystopian fantasies
                emerging from America, but The Hunger Games is the most
                profoundly imagined, nightmarish, romantic, psychologically
                plausible and well-written. You can’t stop reading, once begun…
                The Hunger Games trilogy is more than just a very clever futuristic
                thriller. It’s quite possibly the best SF novel for teenagers since
                Huxley’s Brave New World.“

                Amanda Craig on Mockingjay

                “Appeals equally to boys as to girls … the stunning action
                sequences and the cleverness of concept and execution give this a
                haunting philosophical complexity and make it my book of the
                year.”

                Amanda Craig on The Hunger Games

                “A brilliantly imagined dystopian novel about the ultimate
                television reality game for teens.”

                Daily Telegraph

                “A throbbingly tense thriller”

                Emma Donoghue

                “What elevates Suzanne Collins’s novel is her ability to build and
                sustain tension… This is a fine entry into the canon of
                post-apocalyptic brutality fiction.”

                Financial Times

                “Brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced”

                John Green

                “With a plot twist at the end of every chapter and a relentless
                pace … The Hunger Games are a masterclass in suspense fiction.

                Lancashire Evening Press on The Hunger Games

                “One of the best-written and thought-provoking books I’ve read
                for a long time”

                Rick Riordan

                “I was so obsessed with this book … The Hunger Games is amazing.”

                Stephanie Meyer

                “As close to a perfect adventure novel as I’ve ever read.”

                Rick Riordan

                “Constant suspense … I couldn’t stop reading”

                Stephen King

                “[Catching Fire is] just as exciting as The Hunger Games, but even
                more gut wrenching, because you already know these characters,
                you’ve already suffered with them. Suzanne takes the story places
                I wasn’t expecting, and she’s never afraid to take it to very hard
                places. Stunning.”

                Stephenie Meyer on Catching Fire

                “Terrifying, exhilarating and unexpectedly thought-provoking.”

                Sunday Telegraph

                “A superb slice of sci-fi dystopia … Collins’s prose is as punchy
                and energetic as her plot, making for a gripping, powerful read.”

                The Scotsman

                “At its best the trilogy channels the political passion of 1984, the
                memorable violence of A Clockwork Orange, the imaginative
                ambience of The Chronicles of Narnia and the detailed
                inventiveness of Harry Potter. The specifics of the dystopian
                universe, and the fabulous pacing of the complicated plot, give the
                books their strange, dark charisma.”

                The Scotsman

                “With its unforgettable heroine, this is an outstanding book for
                both genders that grips like a man-trap.”

                The Times on The Hunger Games

                “A challenging, powerful and remarkably intelligent read that
                will stay with you; definitely not just your average teen novel.”

                "Tension, fear, sadness and a whole different perspective on life are in this story. Katniss and the other children prepare and fight in the Hunger Games.
                We discover why and how they deal with society’s truths.
                I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to step outside the usual limits of their own fears."

                Anyone remember "The Running Man?" Here again we have a society where there is a huge discrepancy between the haves and have-nots, and watching people suffer on live tv is considered entertainment. But this story is more heartbreaking and engaging in its delivery. Here we have 12 districts under tyrannical rule of "The Capital," and as punishment for a rebellion 74 years ago each district has to send two children (one male, one female) between the ages 12 - 16 to fight to the death in an arena. This is The Hunger Games and there can only be one winner, so even allies will need to turn on each other eventually. Mandatory viewing for all of Panem, the districts watch helplessly as their children are forced to kill each other in order to survive. The winner is compensated with wealth, a new house, and fame. They also get to mentor the next year's 'lucky' contestants when it's time.
                Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are this year's lucky winners from District 12, and what begins as a tv romance to boost ratings turns into real feelings for them both. Peeta has liked Katniss since they were young, but Katniss is usually so focused on survival she doesn't examine her own feelings or notice how others feel about her. It turns out her best friend and hunting partner, Gale, also has feelings for her and there becomes a "Team Peeta" vs "Team Gale" debate within the reader.
                Katniss outsmarts the game rules and as a result both her and Peeta are the winners of this year's Hunger Games. What she considered just trying to survive ignites and fuels the rebellion already brewing in many districts. Panem's president is not pleased, and we are left knowing that survival for Katniss will no longer be just about food.
                I could not walk away from this story - not since Harry Potter has a story so captivated me. Maybe it's the horrible injustice, maybe it's the love triangle, maybe it's the story of how survival outweighs the consequences of society's rules - whatever it is, I couldn't wait to begin the next book.

                Ordered all 3 books of the series and love them. It's a great story, well written and it keeps you on the edge of you seat from beginning to end. I recommand all 3 books without hesitation. It's too bad the the movie, following the books, was a bit of a let down. I find that the director did not do the books justice in the movie, and there were too many discrepancies from the book.
